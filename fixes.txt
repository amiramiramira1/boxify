fixes:
✔️add description to boxes
✔️add start date to subscription model and make next payment date default to one month from now
✔️add foreign key user and box to subscription model
✔️get all subscription by user id (populate)
✔️get all orders by user id (populate)
✔️common controller(and route) for buying boxes check type to know create subscription or order only userinputinbody: userid,boxid,address
✔️get all user information including orders and subscriptions //my idea
✔️validate email is unique and is email (regular expression)
✔️try and catch any database operation
✔️validate all routes with express validator  






for later: 
implement user token jws



my ideas:
validate especially that ids exists
test all types of inputs ensure no server crash
